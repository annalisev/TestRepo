Repository: Collection of stuff
Commit: Make a save
  You can add a note with every commit (save)
  Each commit can be identified by a unique hash


In a repository you have a main (master) branch and also other branches
  branches allow you to have different files in parallel that stem from the same file

A pull request can bring changes made into branches into the main version

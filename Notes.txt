Repository: Collection of stuff
Commit: Make a save
  You can add a note with every commit (save)
  Each commit can be identified by a unique hash


In a repository you have a main (master) branch and also other branches
  branches allow you to have different files in parallel that stem from the same file

A pull request can bring changes made into branches into the main version

Forking a repository means taking an instance of a repository from someone elses account and bringing it to your own account in a new repository, so you can freely make changes without affecting the original reopsitory
You can then send code youo have perfected in your new repository back to the old repository you got it from in order to help that person through a pull request. The orignal person can then choose to accept or reject your changes

Issues can be raised by people working on a repository. They are found in the issues tab. They can then be addressed and then the issue will be closed.
